# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Example:
# SERVERVAR="foo"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENTVAR="bar"

# Email Configuration for Contact Form
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your email service details

# SMTP Server Configuration
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Destination email (where contact form messages will be sent)
EMAIL_TO=your-email@gmail.com

# For Gmail:
# 1. Enable 2-factor authentication
# 2. Generate an "App Password" for this application
# 3. Use the app password as EMAIL_PASS (not your regular password)

# For other email providers:
# - Outlook/Hotmail: smtp-mail.outlook.com, port 587
# - Yahoo: smtp.mail.yahoo.com, port 587
# - Custom SMTP: Use your provider's SMTP settings
